Kaggle
======
This repository is for code I created for Kaggle projects.  Currently, there is only one here (the Titanic project) but I plan to add more as I do more projects.
To use the code, you need to include the jars for log4j and the Learning project.

Code may be used for the benefit of education only.  Code for a competition may not be used for that competition while the competition is still going on.
